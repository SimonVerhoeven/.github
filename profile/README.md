WireMock is a free and open source tool for building and testing mock APIs.
WireMock frees you from dependency on unstable APIs and allows you to develop with confidence.
It's easy to launch a mock API server and simulate a host of real-world scenarios and APIs - including REST, SOAP, OAuth2 and more.
